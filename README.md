# OSCP cheat sheet

Just some oscp cheat sheet stuff that I copied for myself. It may look messy, I will rewrite it to improvement for OSCP preparation.

The content in this repo. is not meant to be a full list of commands that you will need in OSCP. It rather just a list of commands that I found them useful with a few notes on them.
